## What is a model
A **model** is an informative representation of a system. GrowthOS is prepared to deal with abstract (i.e. conceptual) models. The following are some examples of conceptual models:
- Mathematical
- Economic
- Statistical
- Marketing

Our experimentation framework will allow us to test how accurate our models are, and will allow us to correct them when needed.

**TL;DR**
Models are *not precise enough* and require *experiments* to *refine the model*.

## What is a plan
**Planning** is the process of thinking regarding the activities required to achieve a desired goal.^[[Wikipedia: planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning)]

## Experiments
An **experiment** is a procedure carried out to support or refute a *hypothesis*, or determine the *efficacy* or *likelihood* of something previously untried. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated.^[Wikipedia: experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment)

# A culture of data curiosity and experimentation
One of the most noticeable differences between an ordinary and a truly innovative ventures is their ubiquitous culture for experimentation. These kind of ventures dare to ask "What if..." questions on every possible situation, on every team, domain or organisational function; and they do it a all times. 

*But how do they manage to run all those experiments and keep productive?*
They know how to run experiments efficiently, they are masters of the scientific method and use frameworks for getting the insights they need to make better decisions.

## The model <-> plan dance

The image below is to be read from left to right and follows the following process:
1. You **start with a model**, simple, with lots of unknowns (i.e. assumptions)
	- from the model you **create a plan**
2. You **design a set of experiments** that will help understand if your assumptions are right or wrong
3. You **revise the model** based on the new evidence collected
	- you **create a new plan** based on the new model
