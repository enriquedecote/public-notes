Where ==Data driven processes== meet ==Experimentation ==- ==Agile== - ==Growth hacking== and ==Lean startup==

![[GrowthOSmap.jpeg]]

The GrowthOS uses a combination of [SOTA Agile principles](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) and [growth hacking principles](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Growth-Fastest-Growing-Companies-Breakout/dp/045149721X).

The diagram above shows GrowthOS's core functions divided in three streams:
1. The growth framework. Functions that directly target growth objectives
2. Agile. Functions that are tight to Agile operations
3. Data & AI. Data driven functions

The diagram also show how the [[Automatic sanity check engine|automatic sanity check engine]] is used through all phases of a venture path to maturity.
