At the core, AI opportunities exist at the intersection of Data, Decisions and Technology.

1.  **Data (the feedstock):** We need to make sure we are sourcing good data, [Module 5: Data](https://hypergrowthhq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MOOD/pages/874676631) makes sure weâ€™re on track there.
2.  **Decisions (the target):** AI should enable better decisions.
     - **Simple.** They are easiest to automate. Conventional rule of thumb: "anything a human can do in 1 second or less".
    -  **Frequent.** Any decision that must be made with high frequency, even if it is low impact, is a good candidate for disrupting with AI.
    -  **Impactful.** Here, AI doesn't have to completely take over the decision, only assist to a meaningful degree.
    -  **Unexpected.** AI that can change the rules of the game.
3.  **Technology (the glue):** Does the tech create new capabilities of the following kind?
     - **New.** What can we do now that we couldn't do before? e.g. OCR, NLP, image recognition
    -  **Upcoming.** What new capabilities are opened up by upcoming technology? processing power, data ingestion, tooling etc.
    -  **Insufficient.** What capabilities have we written off as being insufficient based on current technology?
    -  **Analogistic.** Analogous capability where AI has been transformational. E.g. RPG games to supply chains
    -  **Accessible.** What capabilities are now too expensive or require too much expertise to properly utilise?
        

## The 4A's framework

This framework suggests we consider the following four factors when identifying opportunities for AI:

1.  **Automation.** Identify tasks and processes that can be automated using AI, such as data entry or image recognition.
2.  **Augmentation.** Look for ways that AI can enhance human capabilities, such as through natural language processing or computer vision.
3.  **Amplification.** Consider how AI can be used to make better decisions or improve performance, such as through predictive analytics or machine learning.
4.  **Autonomy.** Identify areas where AI can operate independently, such as self-driving cars or drones.

Note that this module is not about assessing the opportunity from a growth perspective. Instead, this is being assessed on [Module 7: Growth Value](https://hypergrowthhq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MOOD/pages/874676725)

# Assessing the opportunity

## Prioritise list by value

Objective: to assess the potential business and financial value of the various possible AI implementations we've identified.

Can AI help meet users' needs?

## Assess the Capability gap
There's a stark difference between what you want to accomplish and what you have the organizational ability to actually achieve within a given time frame. We want to understand what is within capability and what is not, from a tech and business process perspective, before launching into a full-blown AI implementation.

Identify:

1.  What needs to be acquired
2.  Processes that need to be internally evolved before we get going

## Assessing the data state
We need to assess whether the data available is high enough quality for AI. We will test for:

-   accuracy
-   completeness
-   uniqueness
-   timeliness
-   validity
-   sufficiency
-   relevancy
-   representativeness
-   consistency
