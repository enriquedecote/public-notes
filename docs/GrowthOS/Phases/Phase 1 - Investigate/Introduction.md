## What it is

The Investigate Phase is the “get to know” phase between the project creators and the Hypergrowth team. The aim is to assess the project’s key foundations and map any gaps that need to be filled making recommendations but not working on these areas until after the phase is complete and we are all aligned with the proposal and both sides have signed off to proceed as planned.

## What it isn’t

What the Investigate phase isn't is mapping gaps and filling them. This is a journey embarked on by both Hypergrowth and the opportunity team to assess the opportunity and understand how we can work together. The output from this phase will be a proposal document, which will highlight the size of the opportunity and the path ahead, before pushing the button on building and growing. 

## How it runs

We kick off with a workshop with all key members of the team starting with an overview of what the Investigate phase is and allowing all module owners (Drivers) to briefly introduce the 8 modules and what they aim to achieve.

We all participate in completing module 1: Vision during this session to kick the project off to a great start with alignment and high energy before diving into parallel work streams to get to the finish line: the [3. Proposal](https://hypergrowthhq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MOOD/pages/876773439). 

The parallel workstreams (modules 2-8) will complete the modules after the kick-off to ensure that by the time we get to the closing session we have all insights, gaps mapped and recommendations compiled. This means that Drivers will self organise with the opportunity team to set up any working sessions or request access to any client-side platforms to complete their module as needed.
