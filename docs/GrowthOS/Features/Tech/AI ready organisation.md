## MLOps
A set of processes and tools for managing the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning (ML) models, from development to deployment and maintenance.

The main goal of this feature is to accelerate the deployment of ML models and ensure their reliability, performance and accuracy in production.

## Automations
1. RACI
2. Standard operating procedures (SOPs)

## AI marketing
SMEs can use machine learning to optimise their marketing campaigns, target the right customers, and personalise their offerings. ML algorithms can help SMEs analyse customer data to identify patterns and make accurate predictions about customer behaviour and preferences.

## Knowledge retrieval
The process of extracting relevant information or knowledge from all your text data (Word and Google docs, pdfs, Notion, emails, Slack channels, etc.). We train large language models (LMMs) such as chatGPT on your data to unlock its full potential. Then we put this powerful tool where you need it the most: 
- Retrieve knowledge by asking a question to your LMM directly on Slack or WhatsApp.
- The retrieved knowledge can then be presented to the user in a structured and understandable format, such as a summary or a list of related articles or resources.

### Examples
Below are some examples where the executive Jane requests help of its LMM named "Bot"

??? note "Jane needs some information from the database"

	**Jane:** Hey Bot, can you help me find some information on the latest server upgrades in our company's datacenter?
	
	**Bot:** Of course, Jane. I can retrieve the relevant information from the company's database. Can you please provide me with your login credentials for access to the datacenter?
	
	**Jane:** Sure, my username is "jane.doe" and my password is "p@ssword123".
	
	**Bot:** Great, I'm able to access the datacenter now. Can you please specify the exact timeframe you are looking for information on?
	
	**Jane:** Yes, I need to know about server upgrades that have happened within the last 3 months.
	
	**Bot:** Understood. Here are the details of the latest server upgrades in the datacenter that have occurred within the last 3 months:
	
	-   On February 15, 2023, the company upgraded 20 servers in the datacenter to the latest generation with improved processing power and memory.
	-   On March 2, 2023, the company replaced 10 ageing servers with new ones that have better energy efficiency and cooling capabilities.
	-   On March 7, 2023, the company installed a new backup server in the datacenter to improve disaster recovery capabilities.
	
	**Jane:** Thanks, Bot. That's exactly the information I needed. Can you also provide me with any other relevant datacenter-related news or updates that have been shared internally within the company?
	
	**Bot:** Sure. There was a recent security incident that occurred on March 10, 2023, where an unauthorised user gained access to the datacenter and attempted to steal confidential information. However, the company's security team was able to quickly identify and mitigate the threat, and there was no data loss or disruption to services. Additionally, the datacenter team is planning to implement a new virtualisation technology in the coming weeks to improve resource utilisation and reduce costs.

??? note "Jane needs a reminder of the resolutions during board meetings in a date-range"

	**Jane:** I need some help retrieving information on the resolutions and next action items resolved during board meetings that happened between Q1 and Q3 of 2022.
