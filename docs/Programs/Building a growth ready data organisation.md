## A story about data culture
In a growth ready data org, each functional department --e.g. Growth, Product, Engineering, etc., which we call here **domain**-- is owner, and therefore, accountable of the data it is producing (be that first order or higher order data).  In this way, we're making sure we can trust the data and get "data literacy" straight from the get-go.

### Squads
Cross functional teams (for example, the ones targeted to growth objectives such as *Acquisition*, *Activation* and *LTV*) are called **squads**. Squads can harnesses the value of analytical data (since the day it was formed) due to our DataOps tech stack. 

## The DataOps tech stack
By deploying our DataOps tech stack data is swiftly accessible across functions and domains of the organisation.

### Data storage 
1. Data lake. The storage system we use to hold large amount of raw data in its original format until it is needed. We use this as the source of data being fed to the data warehouse.
2. Data warehouse. A large, centralised repository of data from multiple sources, used for storing and analysing data to support decision-making in the organisation. We use it to store structured data. It is used to support fast querying and analysis of the data for business intelligence purposes.

### Data operations
A set of tools and processes that aim to improve the speed, quality, and reliability of data processing and analytics. It is a collaboration between data scientists, engineering and business stakeholders.
