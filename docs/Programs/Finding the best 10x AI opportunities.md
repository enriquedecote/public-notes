## TL;DR

- Real 10x AI/ML opportunities usually have an inverse 80/20 rule: the real returns start to appear in the last 20% of the effort.
- It is deceptively easy to build AI proof of concepts that get stakeholders excited, it is a very different ball game to identify the real winners, quantify the efforts needed to implement and scale. 
- All AI opportunities require a considerable amount of quality data. Fortunately, [[Building a growth ready data organisation|we have you covered]].

Most (if not all) tech founders and C-suite venture executives have thought about the prospect of jumping into the AI bandwagon. The appetite is there,  however, most tech companies that have tried to implement an AI initiative end up with isolated POCs across multiple areas. These POCs have ==less than 30% chance== of generating any value for the company. [^1]

The reason for such a terrible hit rate is not hard to understand, AI and machine learning are one of those areas where, unfortunately, the 80/20 rule does not apply. [^2]
[^2]: The 80-20 rule, also known as the *Pareto Principle*, is a familiar saying that asserts that 80% of outcomes (or outputs) result from 20% of all causes (or inputs) for any given event.

In fact, it is the inverse that actually apply. Most out-of-the-box algorithms that you can pull from a GitHub repository can get you to over 80% of performance with minimal effort (e.g. identify cats on 80% of images that do contain cats or correctly identifying over 80% spam email as spam) but,

    Most industrial applications require AI to perform at a 95% to 99% accuracy

In other words, most of the real 10x returns begin when you reach that sweet spot of algorithmic accuracy demanded by your industry. 

## How do we spot true opportunities

??? success "1. Align with company-level priorities"
    The AI agenda needs to align to what matters most to the company (expansion to new regions, organic growth or deliver a new user functionality)

??? success "2. Define value for today with a vision for tomorrow"

it boils down to proven frameworks and lots of experience implementing AI systems in the real world.

### AI frameworks
At the core, AI opportunities exist at the intersection of Data, Decisions and Technology, as depicted in the figure below. 
![[venn_opportunities.jpeg|500]]
For example, here are some questions that this framework will help clarify :
- Is there data containing the information we need? (even if disguised or buried)
- Is it ethical and safe to use the data?
- Can AI help meet users' needs?

### Growth frameworks
Here we will look at the AI concepts through growth lenses — how good are we prepared to build our acquisition (or growth) loops. We will look first at what we have, how it works and what’s the output. Some of the frameworks that are useful at this phase include the 4-fits model and the iterative market-product fit.

#### The 4-fits model
It basically answers how well our business model is connected with reality.
1.  Market→Product fit = do we have a product for the market?
2.  Product→Channel fit = does our product fit existing channels? which?
3.  Channel→Model fit = how channels work for our pricing model; CAC, ARPU, GTV etc.
4.  Model→Market fit = sanity check; how our financials work for the market that we are trying to conquer

Playing with this canvas is well explained by Brain Balfour.

### Idea prioritisation matrix
**Objective:** to assess the potential business and financial value of the various possible AI implementations we've identified.

After having assessed the opportunities around the two driving forces (tech and growth), it is time to understand what opportunity (if any) makes sense to deep dive into. We use a prioritisation matrix for this where we objectively quantify risk and value levers in order to find the best fit. 

## What happens after spotting the best opportunities?
Now that you've spotted the best opportunities, it is time to prototype, learn how to kill dead-ends fast and finally, ==scale== the prototypes that get though all our rigorous tests.


Do you have what it takes to take your AI initiative to the next level?
