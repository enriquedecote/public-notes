## TL;DR

- Real 10x AI/ML opportunities usually have an inverse 80/20 rule: the real returns start to appear in the last 20% of the effort.
- It is deceptively easy to build AI proof of concepts that get stakeholders excited, it is a very different ball game to identify the real winners, quantify the efforts needed to implement and scale.

Most (if not all) tech founders and C-suite venture executives have thought about the prospect of jumping into the AI bandwagon. The appetite is there,  however, most tech companies that have tried to implement an AI initiative and up with independent, disconnected POCs across multiple domains that have ==less than 30%== of generating any value for the company. ^[https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/tipping-the-scales-in-ai]

The reason for such a terrible hit rate is not hard to understand, AI and machine learning are one of those areas where, unfortunately, the 80/20 rule does not apply. ^[The 80-20 rule, also known as theÂ *Pareto Principle*, is a familiar saying that asserts that 80% of outcomes (or outputs) result from 20% of all causes (or inputs) for any given event.]

"Top performers recognise that most of the impact comes from the last **20%** of the journey" ~McKinsey

In fact, it is the inverse that actually apply. Most out-of-the-box algorithms that you can pull from a GitHub repository can get you to over 80% of performance with minimal effort (e.g. identify cats on 80% of images that do contain cats or correctly identifying over 80% spam email as spam) but,

!!! info Most industrial applications require AI to perform at a 95% to 99% accuracy.

In other words, most of the real 10x returns begin when you reach that sweet spot of algorithmic accuracy demanded by your industry. 

## How do we spot true opportunities

??? question 1. Align with company-level priorities
The AI agenda needs to align to what matters most to the company (expansion to new regions, organic growth or deliver a new user functionality)


it boils down to proven frameworks and lots of experience implementing AI systems in the real world

At the core, AI opportunities exist at the intersection of Data, Decisions and Technology.



## Assessing the opportunity

### Prioritise list by value

Objective: to assess the potential business and financial value of the various possible AI implementations we've identified.

Can AI help meet users' needs?

## What happens after spotting the best opportunities?
Now that you've spotted the best opportunities, it is time to prototype, lear how to kill dead-ends fast and finally, ==scale== the prototypes that get though all our rigorous tests.

### Scaling
